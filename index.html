        <h3>Journey to the Hewitt</h3>
        <small>Kevin Bartlett-Hillier - 2014</small>
        <p>I first heard about the Hewitt when I joined the OHGS (Old Haileyburian Golf Society) in 2014. At the time my
          handicap was 10 on paper, but realistically I was playing to about a 14 or so. Playing in the Hewitt was a pipe
        dream I didn't even really consider as an option. But now that I've made it I thought it would be worth thinking
        about the journey.</p>

        <h3>Uni Golf</h3>
        <small>Kevin Bartlett-Hillier - 2017</small>
        <p>After not playing at all in my first year of uni I was thrilled to see a new golf team had been set up ahead
        of my second year. Of course, I immediately signed up and was one of 8 who did so. Only one guy was playing to a
        decent level at the time but I was determined to put in the grind and become a useful option. By the end of my two
        years on the team I was playing to roughly a seven handicap and would back myself to win most of my matches.</p>

        <h3>Post Uni slump</h3>
        <small>Kevin Bartlett-Hillier - 2018</small>
        <p>After putting in so much work at uni on my game it's disappointing to look back and realise how little I was
        able to play in the couple of years after I left. I was able to play a round here or there but with no regularity
        and I soon lost a lot of the consistency I had gained over the previous two years.</p>

        <h3>Joining Wanstead</h3>
        <small>Kevin Bartlett-Hillier - 2019</small>
        <p>After buying my flat in 2019 I quickly scoped out the nearest course and set upon joining. Membership isn't
        cheap, but it was, and has been, worth it to try and achieve my goal. I was finally able to get a proper handicap
        for the first time in about 5 years. If I remember correctly it was 14, which was met by jeers whenever people saw
        my swing, but I never managed to win anything and worked hard to try and live up to the potential.</p>

        <h3>The Big Drop</h3>
        <small>Kevin Bartlett-Hillier - 2022</small>
        <p>The summer of 2020 my handicap was in the 12 range, but since I was working from home and not able to do much
        else with my free time, I really leant into the grind and worked hard to improve my game. I managed to break into
          single digits in June 2020, something I'd been waiting for years to see. At the time I thought I'd reached my
        peak for the season but the numbers kept on falling. In September 2020 I went down to ROyal St Georges for the
        Autumn Meeting where I shot a 77, that's when the Hewitt chatter began, I'd finally opened their eyes to the
        possibility of my selection. By the end of the year I was down to a 6 handicap.</p>
        <p>The following year I picked up right where I left off, rarely had a game where I shot higher than the 70s and
        kept bringing my handicap down. In September 2022 I had a great streak, shooting 75, 76, 75 at Wanstead and then,
        at that years Autumn Meeting, I shot a 72 in a three club wind in what was my sixth round in four days. That was
        when I really knew I had a shot at making the team.</p>
        <p>I got invited down to Royal St Georges by some of our members in November 2022 where I was paired with Stu, a
        perennial Hewitt player who was a perfect, consistent foil to my erratic game. We crushed our opponents that day,
        only making one error between us.</p>

        <h3>The Call Up</h3>
        <small>Kevin Bartlett-Hillier - 2023</small>
        <p>In February 2023 I attended the Hewitt trial where I was pretty out of form. I actually thought going down
        there that day was more likely to hurt my chances than help them. However, something about that course brings
        the best out of me and I crushed it. We played two rounds that day. In the morning, Stu and I shot 4 over, 9 shots
        better than the next best pair, and in the afternoon we shot 6 over, 3 better than the next best. I drove away that
        night knowing they had no choice but to call me up.</p>
        <p>Two days later, Jeremy called me to give me the good news.</p>
